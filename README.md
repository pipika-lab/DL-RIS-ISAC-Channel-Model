# RIS-Assisted V2V ISAC Channel Modeling and Learning Framework

This repository provides the simulation codes, statistical modeling modules, and learning-based enhancement algorithms for the paper:

**"Deep-Learning-Driven Non-Stationary 3D Channel Modeling for RIS-Assisted V2V Integrated Sensing and Communications"**

The project develops a physics-based geometric stochastic channel model (GBSM) for RIS-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, and further incorporates a supervised learning-based MLP neural network to enhance channel statistic prediction accuracy and reduce computational complexity.

## Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Channel Simulation
Run:
```matlab 
main_simulation_ccf.m
main_simulation_acf.m
main_simulation_fcf.m
This will generate: theoretical CCF / ACF / FCF curves; RIS size comparison results; sensing vs communication statistics.

2️⃣ Dataset Generation
generate_training_dataset.m
rho_CCF_*.fig
rho_ACF_*.fig
rho_FCF_*.fig
These files serve as ground-truth labels for neural network training.

3️⃣ Train MLP Model
main_train_mlp_multi_input_dynamic.m

Includes:
multi-dimensional physical features
normalization
adaptive sampling
performance evaluation (RMSE / MAE / R²)

4️⃣ Prediction & Comparison
main_predict_and_compare.m

Generates:
theoretical vs predicted curves
error metrics
visualization plots

🧠 Methodology Overview

Channel Modeling:
The RIS reflection coefficient of each element is modeled as χ_(m_x,m_z ) (t) e^(jφ_(m_x,m_z ) (t) )，which directly influences the spatio-temporal channel responses via e^(j(φ_(m_x,m_z ) (t)-φ_(m_x,m_z ) (t+Δt))).
This phase-difference term explicitly affects: spatial CCFs, temporal ACFs, propagation non-stationarity.
Larger RIS dimensions introduce stronger phase diversity, resulting in faster correlation decay.

Learning Enhancement:
The MLP learns the nonlinear mapping: Physical Parameters→Statistical Channel Metrics
Advantages: (1) avoids repeated integral computations; (2) accelerates simulations; (3) preserves physical interpretability; (4) suitable for real-time system design.

📊 Example Results

Typical observations:
spatial correlations decay with antenna spacing
temporal ACFs show non-stationary behavior
sensing channel exhibits stronger fluctuations than communication channel
larger RIS → lower spatial correlation
MLP predictions closely match theoretical curves

🔬 Reproducibility Tips

Fix random seed: rng(2024)
Increase RIS size gradually (30×30 → 100×100)
Ensure dataset normalization before training
Use sufficient samples (>1000) for stable learning

⭐ Notes

This repository aims to bridge: Physics-based modeling + Data-driven learning to provide an efficient and interpretable solution for RIS-assisted V2V ISAC channel analysis.
